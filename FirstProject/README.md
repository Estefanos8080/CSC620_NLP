## CSC6290 - Project 1
 #### NLP project
    #### objective:
            - Create a copy of the ELIZA program and add detailed comments that explain your understanding of the code.  Do this for every code block, and especially for every response pair. 
            - Add 5 new response pairs that provide simple emotional support for college students by being a good "listener". For example, when the user says "The finals week has been tough", the chatbot could respond "I hear you. Finals week is tough for many. Do you want to tell me more?"
